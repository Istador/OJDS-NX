# Open Joystick Display Server NX

This is a very simple system module that listens for Open Joystick Display to request controller inputs, and then send back the controller inputs to be displayed. To install simply put the contents of the zip file in the root of your SD card. Thanks to Jakibaki for most of the code in this and for the help on Discord.
